# SkiAlertMe

This project runs an automated script to email a given list of emails a snow report about a desired ski mountain (in this case, Stratton Mountain). I utilize the WeatherUnlocked API to gather weather and snow data, and parse the API call in order to pack a the desired data points into a message to be emailed. Included in the message are snow total estimates and weather reports for the next 2-days for the desired ski resort.
